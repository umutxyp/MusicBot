# Discord.js v14 Slash Commands Music Bot

## Bot Setup

[Click here for a setup video](https://youtu.be/LQ24tdW5d8k), but these instructions are up to date so make sure to follow them if the video is different.

- Clone this repository or download as a zip and extract the contents.
- Rename `token-example.js` to `token.js`
- Replace `YOUR TOKEN HERE` with your bot token from the Discord Developer page. (see the setup video above for how to set up a Discord bot and get your token)
- Then, you can either run the bot normally or you can set it up in Windows Task Scheduler.

### Run Normally
- Rename `start.bat.example` to `start.bat`
- Open the Start Menu and type `cmd`, then open Command Prompt (PowerShell or Windows Terminal will also work)
- Change to your bot folder by doing `cd YOUR\BOT\FOLDER` (Note: Change your drive letter first if your bot is on another drive letter by typing `E:` (if E is your drive))

### Set up in Windows Task Scheduler
- Rename `schedule.bat.example` to `schedule.bat`
- Replace all `DRIVELETTER` with the drive that your bot folder is located on
- Change `\YOUR\BOT\DIRECTORY` to the exact directory your bot is located in (where you cloned or extracted in the first step above)
- Point your Windows Task Schedule to this `schedule.bat`
