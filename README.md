## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ‚â• 18 (LTS recommended) and npm.
- **Git** for cloning the repository.
- **Discord application** with a bot user created in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- *(Optional but recommended)* A VPS or host with stable bandwidth and low latency to Discord voice regions.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è `ffmpeg-static` ships with the project. You do **not** need a system-wide FFmpeg unless you prefer using a custom build.

---

## Quick Start

### Windows fast track

```powershell
# Run from the repo root
.\setup.bat
# Edit the generated .env with your credentials
.\start.bat
```

`setup.bat` verifies Node.js/npm, installs dependencies, and scaffolds a `.env` template if you don‚Äôt have one yet. `start.bat` makes sure your environment is ready and launches the bot via `npm run start`.

### Cross-platform manual steps

```powershell
# 1. Clone & enter
git clone https://github.com/umutxyp/musicbot.git discord-musicbot
cd discord-musicbot

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Configure secrets (see below)
Copy-Item .env .env.backup -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
# Edit .env with your token, client ID, Spotify credentials, etc.

# 4. Boot the bot
npm run start
# or
node index.js
```

Slash commands register automatically when the bot starts. Guild-scoped deployment executes within seconds if `GUILD_ID` is provided; global rollout can take up to an hour per Discord caching rules.

---

## Configuration

Beatra reads from both `config.js` defaults and environment variables via `.env`. Update whichever approach fits your hosting workflow.

### `.env` Cheat Sheet

```dotenv
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token
CLIENT_ID=your_application_id
GUILD_ID=optional_guild_for_fast_testing
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=spotify_client_secret
GENIUS_CLIENT_ID=optional_genius_client_id
GENIUS_CLIENT_SECRET=optional_genius_client_secret
STATUS=üéµ Beatra | /play
EMBED_COLOR=#FF6B6B
SUPPORT_SERVER=https://discord.gg/ACJQzJuckW
WEBSITE=https://beatra.app
COOKIES_FROM_BROWSER=chrome
COOKIES_FILE=./cookies.txt
```

### Key Settings

| Setting | Location | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `discord.token` | `.env` ‚Üí `config.discord.token` | Discord bot token used for login and REST registration. |
| `discord.clientId` | `.env` ‚Üí `config.discord.clientId` | Application ID required to register slash commands. |
| `discord.guildId` | `.env` ‚Üí `config.discord.guildId` | Optional testing guild ID for <1 minute command deployment. Leave blank for global registration. |
| `bot.status` | `.env`/`config.js` | Activity text shown as "Listening to ...". |
| `bot.embedColor` | `.env`/`config.js` | Hex color for all embeds. |
| `bot.supportServer` & `bot.website` | `.env`/`config.js` | Populates help links and README badges. |
| `spotify.clientId` & `spotify.clientSecret` | `.env`/`config.js` | Enables Spotify search, playlist and album expansion. |
| `genius.clientId` & `genius.clientSecret` | `.env`/`config.js` | Optional Genius API credentials for higher rate limits (works without via web scraping). |
| `ytdl.cookiesFromBrowser` & `ytdl.cookiesFile` | `.env`/`config.js` | It is an optional feature to add cookies against YouTube cookie errors. |

> üîê Never commit `.env` to source control. Use deployment secrets in your hosting provider or create environment variables at runtime.

---

## Spotify API Setup

1. Visit the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/), sign in, and click **Create an App**.
2. Name your integration (e.g., `Beatra Bot`) and enable **Web API**.
3. Reveal and copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
4. Add a redirect URI (any valid URL, e.g., `https://localhost/callback`) ‚Äì although client credentials flow is used, Spotify requires at least one placeholder.
5. Paste both values into your `.env` (`SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`, `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`).
6. Restart the bot. The credentials are cached and refreshed automatically with the client credentials grant.

Without these credentials Spotify requests fall back to zero results.

---

## Genius API Setup (Optional)

Beatra uses **web scraping** by default to fetch lyrics from Genius‚Äîno API key required! However, if you want **higher rate limits** and **faster responses**, you can optionally add Genius API credentials.

### Why Use Genius API?

| Without API Key | With API Key |
| --- | --- |
| ‚úÖ Works perfectly via web scraping | ‚úÖ Higher rate limits |
| ‚úÖ No registration needed | ‚úÖ Faster response times |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è May hit rate limits on heavy use | ‚úÖ Official API support |

### Setup Steps

1. Visit the [Genius API Clients Page](https://genius.com/api-clients), sign in with your Genius account (or create one).
2. Click **New API Client** and fill in:
   - **App Name:** `Beatra Bot` (or any name)
   - **App Website URL:** `https://localhost` (placeholder is fine)
   - **Redirect URI:** `https://localhost/callback` (not used, but required)
3. Click **Save** and reveal your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
4. Copy both values and add them to your `.env`:
   ```dotenv
   GENIUS_CLIENT_ID=your_genius_client_id
   GENIUS_CLIENT_SECRET=your_genius_client_secret
   ```
5. Restart the bot. The Genius client will now use API authentication.

> üí° **Note:** Even without credentials, lyrics work perfectly! The bot automatically scrapes Genius.com and falls back to LRCLIB if needed.

### Lyrics Priority

The bot fetches lyrics in this order:
1. **Genius** (with API key if provided, otherwise web scraping)
2. **LRCLIB** (free lyrics database)
3. If both fail, no lyrics button appears

---

## YouTube Cookie Setup

YouTube may occasionally block yt-dlp with a "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot" error. To fix this, you need to provide browser cookies to yt-dlp.

### Method 1: Using Browser Cookies (Recommended)

1. Open your `.env` file or set environment variables
2. Add one of the following based on your browser:
   ```env
   # For Chrome users
   COOKIES_FROM_BROWSER=chrome
   
   # For Firefox users
   COOKIES_FROM_BROWSER=firefox
   
   # For Edge users
   COOKIES_FROM_BROWSER=edge
   
   # For Safari users
   COOKIES_FROM_BROWSER=safari
   ```

3. Make sure you're logged into YouTube in that browser
4. Restart your bot

**Note:** This method automatically extracts cookies from your browser, so you need to be logged into YouTube in the specified browser.

### Method 2: Using cookies.txt File

1. Install a browser extension to export cookies:
   - **Chrome/Edge:** [Get cookies.txt LOCALLY](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc)
   - **Firefox:** [cookies.txt](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/)

2. Go to YouTube while logged in and export cookies to a file named `cookies.txt`

3. Place `cookies.txt` in your bot's root directory (same folder as `index.js`)

4. Add to your `.env` file:
   ```env
   COOKIES_FILE=./cookies.txt
   ```

5. Restart your bot

### Verifying the Fix

After setting up cookies, test with:
```bash
npm start
```

If you still see bot detection errors:
- Make sure you're logged into YouTube in your browser
- Try clearing your browser cookies and logging in again
- Regenerate the cookies.txt file
- Try a different browser

**Security Note:** Keep your `cookies.txt` file private and never share it, as it contains your YouTube session data.

## Sharding for Large Bots (1000+ Servers)

When your bot reaches **1,000+ servers**, Discord **requires** you to use sharding to distribute the load across multiple processes. Beatra includes a fully automated sharding system powered by Discord.js's `ShardingManager`.

> üìö **[Read the complete Sharding Guide](./SHARDING.md)** for detailed documentation, troubleshooting, and best practices.

### üéØ What is Sharding?

Sharding splits your bot into multiple instances (shards), each handling a subset of servers:
- **Shard 0** might handle servers 1-1000
- **Shard 1** might handle servers 1001-2000
- And so on...

Discord automatically routes events to the correct shard based on server ID.

### üöÄ Quick Start with Sharding

#### Option 1: Interactive Launcher (Recommended)
```powershell
.\start.bat
```
Choose option **[2] Sharding Mode** when prompted.

#### Option 2: Direct Sharding Launch
```powershell
.\start-shard.bat
# or
node shard.js
```

#### Option 3: Normal Mode (< 1000 servers)
```powershell
node index.js
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Sharding Configuration

Configure sharding in `.env` or `config.js`:

```dotenv
# Sharding Settings
TOTAL_SHARDS=auto              # 'auto' = Discord calculates optimal count
SHARD_LIST=auto                # 'auto' = spawn all shards, or [0,1,2] for specific
SHARD_MODE=process             # 'process' (recommended) or 'worker'
SHARD_RESPAWN=true             # Auto-restart crashed shards
SHARD_SPAWN_DELAY=5500         # Delay between spawning shards (ms)
SHARD_SPAWN_TIMEOUT=30000      # Timeout for shard ready event (ms)
```

### üìä Sharding Modes Explained

| Mode | Description | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **process** | Each shard runs in a separate Node.js process | Production (more stable, isolated memory) |
| **worker** | Each shard runs in a worker thread | Development (less memory, experimental) |

### üî¢ How Many Shards Do I Need?

Discord recommends: **1 shard per 1,000 servers**

| Servers | Recommended Shards |
| --- | --- |
| < 1,000 | No sharding needed (use `node index.js`) |
| 1,000 - 2,000 | 2 shards |
| 2,000 - 3,000 | 3 shards |
| 5,000+ | 5+ shards |

The bot automatically calculates the optimal count when `TOTAL_SHARDS=auto`.

### üìù Sharding Best Practices

1. **Use `auto` for production** ‚Äì Let Discord.js calculate the optimal shard count
2. **Respect spawn delays** ‚Äì Discord rate-limits shard connections (5-5.5 seconds recommended)
3. **Monitor shard health** ‚Äì The shard manager logs each shard's status in real-time
4. **Enable auto-respawn** ‚Äì Crashed shards restart automatically
5. **Use process mode** ‚Äì More stable than worker threads for production

### üîç Monitoring Shards

The bot displays detailed shard information:

```
[SHARD MANAGER] Launching shard 0...
[SHARD 0] ‚úÖ Shard 0 is ready!
[SHARD 0] üéµ Music bot serving 847 servers on this shard!
[SHARD 0] üåê Total servers across all shards: 1523

[SHARD MANAGER] Launching shard 1...
[SHARD 1] ‚úÖ Shard 1 is ready!
[SHARD 1] üéµ Music bot serving 676 servers on this shard!
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Sharding

#### Run Specific Shards
```dotenv
SHARD_LIST=[0,1,2]  # Only spawn shards 0, 1, and 2
```

#### Manual Shard Count
```dotenv
TOTAL_SHARDS=4  # Force 4 shards regardless of server count
```

#### Disable Auto-Respawn (Not Recommended)
```dotenv
SHARD_RESPAWN=false
```

### üö® Important Notes

- **Sharding is mandatory at 1,000+ servers** ‚Äì Discord will reject connections without it
- **Commands work identically** ‚Äì Users see no difference between sharded and non-sharded bots
- **Database remains local** ‚Äì Each shard shares the same `database/languages.json` file
- **Voice connections are isolated** ‚Äì Each shard manages its own voice connections

### üÜò Sharding Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| "Cannot spawn more than X shards" | Discord limits shards based on server count. Use `auto` or contact Discord for limit increase. |
| Shards keep crashing | Check memory usage and increase spawn timeout (`SHARD_SPAWN_TIMEOUT`). |
| Commands not appearing | Wait for all shards to be ready. Global commands can take up to 1 hour to propagate. |
| Bot shows as offline | Ensure all shards are running. Check the shard manager logs. |

---

## Slash Commands & Controls

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/play <query>` | Smart-detects platform links or search keywords, queues playlists/albums, and spins up the control panel. |
| `/search <keywords>` | Presents a paginated selection menu of YouTube matches ‚Äî choose with buttons. |
| `/nowplaying` | Drops the live embed again, including queue status, repeat/shuffle flags, and volume. |
| `/language` | Opens a flag button wall for instant localization (cached per guild). |
| `/help` | Gorgeous, localized feature tour + live stats and support links. |

### On-embed Controls

- **‚è∏Ô∏è / ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Pause & Resume** ‚Äì Auth-limited to DJs, admins, or the original requester.
- **‚è≠Ô∏è Skip** ‚Äì Jumps to the next queued item (requires at least 1 upcoming track).
- **‚èπÔ∏è Stop** ‚Äì Clears queue, tears down voice, and locks the panel.
- **üìã Queue** ‚Äì Renders the next 10 tracks with real-time progress bar.
- **üîÄ Shuffle** ‚Äì Randomizes the queue with guard rails (min. 2 tracks).
- **üîä Volume** ‚Äì Opens a modal allowing 0‚Äì100 input.
- **üîÅ Loop** ‚Äì Cycles through loop modes: Off ‚Üí Track Repeat ‚Üí Queue Repeat. Track mode replays the current song endlessly; Queue mode restarts the entire queue when finished.
- **üé≤ Autoplay** ‚Äì Toggles genre-based autoplay (Off ‚Üí On with genre selection). When enabled, the bot automatically adds matching music from your selected genre when the queue ends, keeping the music flowing seamlessly.

All button sessions carry a short-lived signature, preventing stale interactions from previous queues.

---

## üé≤ Autoplay System

Beatra features an intelligent autoplay engine that keeps the music flowing when your queue runs out.

### How It Works

1. **Enable Autoplay** ‚Äì Click the üé≤ Autoplay button on the now-playing embed
2. **Choose Your Genre** ‚Äì Select from 20 carefully curated genres:
   - üéµ Pop, Rock, Hip-Hop, Electronic, Jazz, Classical, Metal, Country
   - üé∏ R&B, Indie, Latin, K-Pop, Anime, Lo-Fi, Blues, Reggae
   - üéπ Disco, Punk, Ambient, or Random (all genres)
3. **Sit Back & Enjoy** ‚Äì When your queue ends, the bot automatically searches and queues relevant tracks

### Smart Content Filtering

The autoplay system includes sophisticated filters to ensure you only get actual music:

**Duration Limits:**
- ‚úÖ Minimum: 30 seconds
- ‚úÖ Maximum: 10 minutes (600 seconds)
- ‚ùå Filters out: Full movies, podcasts, long tutorials, DJ sets

**Keyword Blocking:**
Automatically skips content containing:
- Tutorial, lesson, course, how-to, guide
- Podcast, interview, talk, speech, lecture
- Review, unboxing, reaction, gameplay
- Full movie, full album, documentary
- ASMR, audiobook, story, meditation
- Mix, compilation (long-form content)

**Quality Checks:**
- Filters excessive emojis (spam/clickbait indicators)
- Blocks playlist-style titles with many brackets
- Prioritizes official music videos and verified uploads

### Genre-Specific Keywords

Each genre uses optimized search terms to find the best content:

| Genre | Search Strategy |
| --- | --- |
| **Anime** | "anime opening official", "anime songs official", "best anime op" |
| **K-Pop** | "kpop official mv", "kpop songs 2024", "korean music official" |
| **Lo-Fi** | "lofi hip hop music", "lofi beats official", "chill lofi music" |
| **Electronic** | "edm music", "electronic dance music", "house music official" |
| **Others** | Similarly optimized with "official", year markers, and quality indicators |

### Fallback Mechanism

If the first search yields no suitable tracks after filtering:
- Automatically retries with a different keyword from the genre pool
- Ensures you always get music, never silence
- Logs the entire process for transparency

### Local Caching Integration

All autoplay tracks leverage the same local cache system as manual plays:
- **Pre-downloaded** before playback starts
- **Zero buffering** during playback
- **Instant playback** from local storage
- **Automatic cleanup** when tracks finish

### Console Transparency

Watch the autoplay engine work in real-time:

```
üé≤ Autoplay: Finding anime music...
‚úÖ Autoplay: Added "YOASOBI - „Ç¢„Ç§„Éâ„É´ (Idol) [Official Music Video]" (244s)
‚¨áÔ∏è Pre-downloading: YOASOBI - „Ç¢„Ç§„Éâ„É´ (Idol) [Official Music Video]
üì• Downloading: YOASOBI - „Ç¢„Ç§„Éâ„É´ (Idol) [Official Music Video]
‚úÖ Downloaded: YOASOBI - „Ç¢„Ç§„Éâ„É´ (Idol) [Official Music Video]
üìä File size: 3.87 MB
üé≤ Autoplay: Now playing "YOASOBI - „Ç¢„Ç§„Éâ„É´ (Idol) [Official Music Video]"
```

### Usage Tips

- **Random Mode** ‚Äì Can't decide? Select "Random" to get music from all genres
- **Queue Priority** ‚Äì Manually added tracks always play before autoplay suggestions
- **Toggle Anytime** ‚Äì Turn autoplay on/off at any point during playback
- **No Spam** ‚Äì Only adds one track at a time as each song finishes

---

## üíæ Local Audio Cache System

Beatra eliminates playback interruptions by pre-downloading and caching all audio locally before streaming to Discord.

### Why Local Caching?

Traditional Discord bots stream directly from YouTube/Spotify/SoundCloud URLs, which causes:
- ‚ùå Random buffering and stuttering during playback
- ‚ùå Voice crackling when your ISP throttles streaming sites
- ‚ùå Stream failures during Discord voice server load spikes
- ‚ùå Quality drops when network conditions fluctuate

**Beatra's solution:**
- ‚úÖ Downloads entire tracks to `audio_cache/` before playback
- ‚úÖ Streams from local disk at consistent quality
- ‚úÖ Zero dependency on external stream stability during playback
- ‚úÖ Instant resume after voice reconnections

### How It Works

1. **Queue Detection** ‚Äì When you add a track with `/play` or autoplay triggers
2. **Background Download** ‚Äì Track downloads silently while previous song plays
3. **Smart Preloading** ‚Äì Entire queue preloads in parallel for instant transitions
4. **Local Streaming** ‚Äì FFmpeg streams the cached file to Discord voice
5. **Automatic Cleanup** ‚Äì Files delete after playback to save disk space

### Console Output Example

```
‚¨áÔ∏è Pre-downloading: Song Title
üì• Downloading: Song Title
‚úÖ Downloaded: Song Title
üìä File size: 4.23 MB
‚úÖ Background download completed: Song Title
üéµ Streaming: Song Title
‚ôªÔ∏è Reusing cached file: Song Title
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Playing from cache: Song Title
üóëÔ∏è Deleted: track_abc123.opus
```

### Technical Details

**Cache Directory:**
- Location: `audio_cache/` (auto-created on first run)
- Format: Opus audio (`.opus` extension) for optimal Discord voice quality
- Naming: `track_[MD5 hash].opus` to prevent conflicts

**Download Process:**
- Uses `youtube-dl-exec` with best audio format selection
- FFmpeg transcodes to Opus for Discord's native codec
- Parallel downloads for multiple queued tracks
- Retry logic for failed downloads with fallback streaming

**Memory Management:**
- Files persist only during active playback
- Automatic deletion after track finishes
- Graceful cleanup on bot shutdown or errors
- Prevents disk bloat with aggressive pruning

**Performance Benefits:**
- **Zero mid-song buffering** ‚Äì entire file ready before playback
- **Fast skip/seek** ‚Äì local I/O is instant vs. network round-trip
- **Reliable autoplay** ‚Äì pre-cached tracks guarantee smooth transitions
- **Network resilience** ‚Äì download failures don't affect current playback

### Disk Space Considerations

Average track sizes:
- **3-5 minutes:** ~3-8 MB
- **Queue of 10 tracks:** ~30-80 MB peak usage
- **Auto-cleanup:** Disk usage drops to ~5-15 MB during playback

The cache system requires minimal disk space and automatically manages itself. For VPS deployments, ensure at least **500 MB free space** for comfortable operation with large queues.

## Language Support

Out-of-the-box translations (and matching flag buttons):

**Arabic**, **German**, **English**, **Spanish**, **French**, **Indonesian**, **Italian**, **Japanese**, **Dutch**, **Portuguese**, **Russian**, **Turkish**, **Traditional Chinese**, **Simplified Chinese**, **Hindi**, **Finnish**, **Danish**, **Norwegian**, **Polish**, **Korean**, **Swedish**

Add your own by copying `languages/en.json`, translating strings, and restarting the bot. The `LanguageManager` hot-loads every JSON file in `languages/`.

---

## Deployment Tips

- **Testing Guild** ‚Äì Set `GUILD_ID` during development to avoid the global propagation delay. Remove it before production to reach every server automatically.
- **Process Manager** ‚Äì Use `pm2`, `systemd`, or Docker to keep the bot alive and restart on crashes. Remember to persist the `database/languages.json` file if you containerize.
- **Logging** ‚Äì Leverage the built-in Chalk-colored console output. Redirect stdout/stderr to log files for long-term monitoring.
- **Scaling** ‚Äì The bot maintains one voice connection per guild. Horizontal scaling requires a shared state & queue (Redis, REST API, etc.) ‚Äî future roadmap material.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Slash commands do not appear | Ensure `CLIENT_ID` is correct and the bot logged in successfully. For new deployments, invite the bot with `applications.commands` scope. |
| Spotify tracks return nothing | Verify `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`/`SECRET` and that the app is approved for Spotify Web API. |
| Bot joins but plays silence | Confirm the host has outbound UDP open, and the voice channel permissions allow **Connect** and **Speak**. |
| Buttons stop working mid-song | Interactions expire after Discord's cache TTL or when a new session is generated. Use `/play` again to refresh the deck. |
| Lyrics button disabled or missing | The bot fetches from Genius first (web scraping or API), then LRCLIB. If both fail, no lyrics button appears. Check console for fetch errors. |
| Command language incorrect | Run `/language`, select your flag, and ensure `database/languages.json` is writable. |
| **YouTube bot detection error** | **YouTube requires bot verification via cookies. See [YouTube Cookie Setup](#youtube-cookie-setup) below for detailed instructions.** |
